*This section is optional and can be used to provide a summary of recommendations to the IT manager regarding which controls and/or compliance best practices Botium Toys needs to implement, based on the risk posed if not implemented in a timely manner.*

**Recommendations :** Based on the assessment results, physical locations such as main office, warehouse, store front of the Botium Toys have solid physical security controls. However, in terms of technical and administrative controls, it lags far behind industry standards and needs to be aligned with compliance in order to keep its reputation and expand the business online.

Legacy systems and manual monitoring, disaster recovery plans, least privilage access, password policies, backups and encryptions need to be implemented and security controls should be integrated for a better security posture and defense against threats to the organization. When serving worldwide customers online, IT team should upgrade the infrastructure to follow best practices of EU data protection GDPR and payment security PCI DSS to reach out for more customers.
