> # Cybersecurity Incident Report: Analyzing brute force attack

**See the "Logs summary" [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HDAQTLSK5CyPLPHeLI0s75kNE-kA2kG0NFJoZlz0xCc/template/preview?resourcekey=0-vDSHnW4qKxOOQtsZeGRUeQ)**.

| Section 1: Identifying the network protocol involved in the incident |
| :----- |
| The process starts with requesting DNS server for IP address of the website. After obtaining the IP address, the browser requests access to web server via HTTP protocol. |

| Section 2: Documenting the incident |
| :----- |
| The incident starts on this morning as the customers complains that the company website yummyrecipesforme.com prompted them to download recipes file from the website. They claimed that after downloading the recipes file, their computers began to run slowly. The website owner tried to access the admin panel but the credentials seemed to have changed. Consequently, the owner reached out to the hosting provider.  

The security team started a response as soon as the alert was raised. In order to address the incident, we created a sandbox environment to identify the behaviour of the website. We used tcpdump to analyze the network traffic flow from the browser in the sandbox to the website. We typed in the URL and once the website loads, we were prompted to download an executable file to update the browser. As soon as we accepted download process and allow the file to run, the browser redirects to a different URL,  greatrecipesforme.com, which is containing malware.

The packet sniffer logs file indicates that when the browser requested IP from DNS server, it replied with a correct one. As soon as we initiating an HTTP request, the website initiated downloading the malware. Then the browser request IP for greatrecipesforme.com from DNS server. DNS server responded with IP for that website and the browser initiated HTTP request to that IP.

A senior security analyst confirmed that the website is compromised. After checking the source code, we found out that a JavaScript code was added to prompt the visitors to download the malware file. The malware file was then examined to have a redirect link to greatrecipesforme.com.

Further investigation indicates that the website was compromised by means of a brute force attack, in which the attacker tried to guess the password and gained access. The weak point is that admin password was still the default password. Furthermore, no security controls were implemented to prevent this kind of attack. |

| Section 3: Recommending remediation methods for brute force attacks |
| :----- |
| In order to prevent these attacks in the future, security controls such as using strong passwords and using MFA to log in to the admin panel are recommended. Default passwords should never be used and the password must follow strong password rules to protect against brute force attacks. MFA strengthens the security of the website by setting another layer of authentication even if the attacker guessed the correct password. That could be, such as sending a security code via SMS to verify the user. Using these controls would prevent brute force attacks and similar attacks in the future. |
