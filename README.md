> # Professional Statement

I am a highly motivated cybersecurity analyst with a strong passion for protecting individuals, organizations, and their assets.

> # Overview

This portfolio highlights the practical security-related operations I completed while pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. Throughout my learning journey, I conducted security audits, performed network analysis, and produced incident reports. I demonstrated my ability to manage file permissions in Linux and use SQL filters to enhance data queries. I created a risk register and recommended the principle of least privilege to help strengthen the security posture of a small business. Additionally, I identified vulnerabilities for another small e-commerce company and recommended remediation strategies. Morevoer, I documented my real-time responses using SIEM and log management tools in an incident handlerâ€™s journal. I also developed a simple Python script to automate file updates. This portfolio is a living document and will continue to grow as I deepen my knowledge and gain more hands-on experience in cybersecurity.
